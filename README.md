# password-hasher

Originally part of a Data Structures project (from 2014), this program was
supposed to be a CLI-based password hasher.  There was an opportunity for extra
credit which asked us to create a GUI for the program.  As of February 20, 2018,
I am revisiting this old assignment in my spare time as a way to practice
building GUIs using Qt.
